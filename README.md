Medicases: Keeping track of Hospitalizations

The motivation behind our Medicases application is to provide a platform for hospitalization record organization during the Covid-19 pandemic. Generally, the application efficiently keeps track of hospitalization records and can be used to keep track of available resources, such as rooms, available in hospitals across the country in real time. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.
The problem is to manage the functioning of Hospitals in a professional and optimal manner. 
The application domain is healthcare, specifically hospital resource management. This type of application is designed to help hospitals efficiently manage their resources, such as beds, medical staff, and equipment. It aims to improve patient care, optimize resource utilization, and support decision-making processes with the hospital environment.
